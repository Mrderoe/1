# A bit helping discord bot code by Mr.dr

# For what's that?
In short, it can help for example to count how much CO2 one or some tree(s) of specific type will remove or help count how much co2 will appear from reaction.
Can be useful for one who planning to plant trees.
# Functional and what special?
Well, at now moment it has 2 commands that can be used. Which commands, you can easily find out by writing !help and discord will show to you.
Maybe not exist other bots like that so in this it special.
# there's no demonstration of work

# how to download and use?
It's simple: you just need to have downloaded discord library and download main file (put also code of your bot in '' where is last string) and library for that.
# if you need to communicate with me, my discord Mr.deroe

# At end
It can be useful for people who needs it, in future it also maybe will be able to show important info that can help informate people. Hard to notice but it actually was made for make some help in global warming. That's all.
